                        <p>No, at DjangoFest, we welcome participants of all genders.</p>

                        <h4>I don't live in Kansas City, can I attend?</h4>
                        <p>Of course! We have had participants from Omaha and Oklahoma City in prior years.</p>

                        <p>No! Workshops are for beginners. You don’t need to know anything about it. However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS are) you still can register!</p>

                        <p>It would be helpful to have Django installed before workshops, but we wouldn't expect you to install anything on your own.</p>
