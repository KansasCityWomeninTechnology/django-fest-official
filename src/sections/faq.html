                <h4>Do I need to know anything about websites or programming?</h4>
                <p>No! Workshops are for beginners. You donâ€™t need to know anything about it. However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS are) you still can register!</p>

                <h4>Do I need to have something installed on my laptop?</h4>
                <p>It would be helpful to have Django installed before workshops, but we wouldn't expect you to install anything on your own.</p>
